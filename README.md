thinkery
============

An apprenticeship project: a breakable toy built from not-suck-cms based on the following whimsical "requirements":

Hello Bendyworks, I'd like you to build me a web app. My brother's friend's girlfriend's uncle's cousin gave me the amazing idea for this application and I know it will be the next Facebook.

So here's the idea: it's called The Thinkery. It's a place for geniuses to grace the world with their thoughts as inspiration strikes. My neighbor is pretty much a genius and has already signed up on my wait list to use this app, so you have to move really fast!!

For the initial release I want anybody to be able to create, edit, and delete ideas. Each idea has a title and a mind-blowing text body. These ideas are going to be really big, so they should be written big across the top of the home page in a menu. I've attached a sketch.
